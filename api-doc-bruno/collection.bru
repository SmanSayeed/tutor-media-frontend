  ### Welcome to Postman! This is your first collection. 
  
  Collections are your starting point for building and testing APIs. You can use this one to:
  
  • Group related requests
  • Test your API in real-world scenarios
  • Document and share your requests
  
  Update the name and overview whenever you’re ready to make it yours.
