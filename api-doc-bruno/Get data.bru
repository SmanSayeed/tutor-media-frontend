docs {
  This is a GET request and it is used to "get" data from an endpoint. There is no request body for a GET request, but you can use query parameters to help specify the resource you want data on (e.g., in this request, we have `id=1`).
  
  A successful GET response will have a `200 OK` status, and should include some kind of response body - for example, HTML web content or JSON data.
